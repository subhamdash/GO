/*os.ReadFile:

os.ReadFile is a simple and convenient function introduced in Go 1.16.
It reads the entire contents of a file into memory as a byte slice ([]byte).
It abstracts away some of the complexities of opening, reading, and closing files by handling these operations internally.
It's suitable for scenarios where you want to read the entire contents of a file into memory and process it as a single entity.

content, err := os.ReadFile("example.txt")


os.OpenFile is a more flexible function that provides lower-level control over file operations.
It opens a file and returns a file descriptor (*os.File), which can be used to read, write, or manipulate the file.
It allows you to specify additional flags and permissions, such as read/write modes, file creation flags, and file permissions.
It's suitable for scenarios where you need fine-grained control over file operations, such as reading or writing specific portions of a file, 
appending to a file, or setting file attributes.

file, err := os.OpenFile("example.txt", os.O_RDONLY, 0644)


os.Open is a function provided by the os package in Go. 
It is used to open a file specified by a path and returns a file descriptor (represented by *os.File) 
that can be used for subsequent file operations like reading, writing, or seeking within the file.

file, err := os.Open("example.txt")

os.ReadFile is a higher-level function optimized for simplicity and ease of use when reading entire file contents into memory, 
while os.OpenFile provides lower-level control and flexibility for more advanced file operations. 
Your choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your file handling needs.
